Consider: Which counties might be poorly served by algorithms that rely on this income data? What factors might contribute to higher uncertainty?]\n\nData that have a high margin of error are less reliable, as the true value of the data is more variable. This can be especially problematic when considering algorithmic decision-making, as a county which seemingly has a high income may be de-prioritized for funding compared to one with a lower income. However, this comparison may not be true if the margin of error for the high-income county is large enough to include the possibility that the average income is in fact lower than the other geography. Looking at the West Virginia dataset, the margin of error for Pendelton County is +/- 16.8%. This means that we cannot confidently say that it has a lower median income than Doddridge, as Doddridge's median income falls within Pendelton's MOE.\n\n# Part 3: Neighborhood-Level Analysis\n\n## 3.1 Focus Area Selection\n\n**Your Task:** Select 2-3 counties from your reliability analysis for detailed tract-level study.\n\n**Strategy:** Choose counties that represent different reliability levels (e.g., 1 high confidence, 1 moderate, 1 low confidence) to compare how data quality varies.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Use filter() to select 2-3 counties from your county_reliability data\n# Store the selected counties in a variable called selected_counties\n\nselected_counties <- data_working %>% \n  filter(new_name %in% c(\"Jefferson\", \"Kanawha\", \"Lewis\"))\n\n# Display the selected counties with their key characteristics\n# Show: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\n\nselected_counties <- selected_counties %>%\n  select(new_name, median_hh_incomeE, INC_MOE_Per, INC_reliability)\n\nkable(selected_counties,\n      col.names = c(\"County\", \"Median Household Income,\", \"Margin of Error\", \"Reliability Category\"),\n      caption = \"Selected Counties and Associated Median Household Incomes\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: Selected Counties and Associated Median Household Incomes\n\n|County    | Median Household Income,| Margin of Error|Reliability Category |\n|:---------|------------------------:|---------------:|:--------------------|\n|Jefferson |                    93744|        5.964115|Moderate Confidence  |\n|Kanawha   |                    55226|        2.987723|High Confidence      |\n|Lewis     |                    50552|       12.151844|Low Confidence       |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Comment on the output:** [write something :)]\n\nBased on my knowledge of the state, I imagine that the MOE is greatly impacted by the total county population.

Do certain types of communities have less reliable data? What might explain this?]\n\nUnfortunately, the data in my selected counties in West Virginia do not have sufficient reliability to make confident use them. This makes sense however, as the average census tract population for the counties I am using is only approx. 3,200 people. Furthermore, these tracts are very racially homogenous, meaning that all tracts have one minority group that is small enough as to create very low confidence data and flag the entire tract as unreliable. \n\n# Part 5: Policy Recommendations\n\n## 5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary\n\n**Your Task:** Write an executive summary that integrates findings from all four analyses.\n\n**Executive Summary Requirements:**\n1. **Overall Pattern Identification**: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses?\n2. **Equity Assessment**: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings?\n3. **Root Cause Analysis**: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk?\n4. **Strategic Recommendations**: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\n  The systematic patterns across all of my analysis reveals that ACS-5 year data are not suitable for confidently assessing racial composition in the three selected counties in West Virginia. Given that the most populous county in West Virginia was included in my sample for census tract-analysis, as well as the county with the highest proportion of Hispanic/Latino residents, it can be assumed that census tracts in the rest of the state have a significant margin of error due to low sample sizes. Median income data is slightly higher quality, with certain counties suitable for immediate algorithmic usage. However, once more, county population significantly impacts data quality, with many rural, low-population counties experiencing significantly lower data confidence. \n  \n  Minority and rural communities face the most significant risk of algorithmic bias in ACS 5-year estimates. In the census-tract data, the MOE that flagged as low-confidence were consistently found in minority communities. Thus, these communities are at risk of being over or under-counted, and thus being mis-represented in decision making that stems from public data analysis such as funding, representation, etc. Rural communities are at risk of having their incomes miscalculated, as certain counties' margin of errors were within the range of each other's estimated value. This means that ranking counties on median income is ineffective, and thus decisions stemming from a ranked approach to resource allocation may under or over-provision resources to counties with low-confidence data.\n  \n  Population size appears to produce low-margins of error. This is likely due to the low sample size of ACS survey respondents associated with rural and low-population communities. This is especially true for minority communities living in ethnically homogeneous low-population regions, as the sample size of minority residents in this community has the potential to be extremely small. Indeed, if the ACS surveys 3% of the US population, in communities where minority groups comprise less than 3% of the total population (such as in sampled WV census tracts), surveyors risk not surveying Hispanic residents of that county. \n  \n  The department should improve bias and errors in its data analysis by flagging counties that are at-risk of algorithmic bias, and supplementing ACS 5-year data with 10 year decennial census data, as 10 year data does not have a margin of error. This protocol should be expanded to require all analysis involving racial composition data to rely on the decennial census, as in West Virginia, there were no counties that had high-confidence racial data profiles. These protocols will mitigate under or overcounting minority populations, and provide more accurate comparisons of income across counties.\n\n## 6.3 Specific Recommendations\n\n**Your Task:** Create a decision framework for algorithm implementation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a summary table using your county reliability data\n# Include: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\n\n# Add a new column with algorithm recommendations using case_when():\n# -

These counties have margins of error between 5 and 10%. \n\n  - Barbour\n  - Boone\n  - Braxton\n  - Cabell\n  - Greenbrier\n  - Hancock\n  - Jefferson\n  - Mercer\n  - Mineral\n  - Monroe\n  - Morgan\n  - Ohio\n  - Preston\n  - Putnam\n  - Raleigh\n  - Randolph\n  - Ritchie\n  - Roane\n  - Tucker\n  - Upshur\n  - Wayne\n  - Wetzel\n\n3. **Counties needing alternative approaches:** [List counties with low confidence data and suggest specific alternatives - manual review, additional surveys, etc.]\n\nThe following counties need further review due to having margins of error exceeding 10%. Additonal data sources should be used such as the decennial census alongside continued monitoring for bias in recommendations. \n\n  - Brooke\n  - Calhoun\n  - Clay\n  - Doddridge\n  - Gilmer\n  - Grant\n  - Hampshire\n  - Jackson\n  - Lewis\n  - Lincoln\n  - Logan\n  - McDowell\n  - Marshall\n  - Mason\n  - Mingo\n  - Nicholas\n  - Pendleton\n  - Pleasants\n  - Pocahontas\n  - Summers\n  - Taylor\n  - Tyler\n  - Wayne\n  - Wirt\n  - Wyoming\n\n## Questions for Further Investigation\n\n[List 2-3 questions that your analysis raised that you'd like to explore further in future assignments. Consider questions about spatial patterns, time trends, or other demographic factors.]\n\n# Technical Notes\n\n**Data Sources:** \n- U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2018-2022 5-Year Estimates\n- Retrieved via tidycensus R package on [date]\n\n**Reproducibility:** \n- All analysis conducted in R version [your version]\n- Census API key required for replication\n- Complete code and documentation available at: [your portfolio URL]\n\n**Methodology Notes:**\n- In determining the class of reliability in census tract- racial data, I developed a new category, Very Low Reliability, with MOEs over 20%. The other categories were defined in accordance with county-level analysis. \n\n**Limitations:**\n- Data limited to ACS survey. Did not check for correlation between population or racial demographics and margin of error.\n\n---\n\n## Submission Checklist\n\nBefore submitting your portfolio link on Canvas:\n\n- [ ] All code chunks run without errors\n- [ ] All \"[Fill this in]\" prompts have been completed\n- [ ] Tables are properly formatted and readable\n- [ ] Executive summary addresses all four required components\n- [ ] Portfolio navigation includes this assignment\n- [ ] Census API key is properly set \n- [ ] Document renders correctly to HTML\n\n**Remember:** Submit your portfolio URL on Canvas, not the file itself.
